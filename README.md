# Educase India React.js intern task by Ibrahim Chikani

## Tech Stack used
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS

## How I built it / Features implemented
1. Utilized the design file to extract the colours and fonts required.
2. Implemented Google's floating label UI in the SignIn and SignUp forms.
3. Used state management in React to track changes in the input fields. This prevents null entries.
4. Used React router to navigate to different pages, ensuring fast load times and security.
5. **Utilized local browser storage to store the user data entered in the forms to ensure dynamic output in the account page.**
6. Ensured the responsiveness of pages.

## Best practices that I followed
- Usage of useState to track form state.
- Usage of useEffect to mount user data dynamically.
- Optimizing page load times, by lazy loading images [from Image in Next.JS].
